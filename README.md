# Technical test: Roller Coaster !

See [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/qhello/roller-coaster-test/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) for test specs.

Implemented in Node.js, using TypeScript & TDD methodology, enclosed in this repo you'll have a working implementation of a Roller Coaster earning calculator.

To use it with demo params:

```
# Clone repository first
git clone https://github.com/qhello/roller-coaster-test.git
cd roller-coaster-test/

npm test
```

Note: I've disabled the two tests "hard" & "harder", as they are running respectively for 25min / 4h, will try to make it faster later.
